# Project 3

This project involved creating, simulating, and mitigating a ransomware scenario. The file titled Project3.py is the emulated threat. This program utilizes a file called target_list.txt to define the targeted files. Additionally, it uses public and private RSA keys to encrypt/decrypt data, respectively. The program features an interactive menu to demonstrate a potential use case. In order to decrypt files, a user must upload the private key to the directory in which the program is located. They must also specify the diretory containing the files to decrypt.

This program has been created for educational use only. The creators intend for this program to be used for threat emulation purposes only.
